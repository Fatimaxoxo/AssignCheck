The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite. It is about 384,400 kilometers away from Earth. The Moon does not produce its own light; it reflects the light of the Sun. Its surface is covered with craters, mountains, and plains called “maria.” The Moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit the Earth and about 29.5 days to go through all its phases, from new moon to full moon. The Moon affects tides on Earth because of its gravitational pull. Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.
