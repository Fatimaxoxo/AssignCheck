The Moon is the Earth’s only natural satellite. It goes around the Earth and shines because it reflects sunlight. The Moon has mountains, craters, and flat areas called “maria.” It takes about 29 days to go from a new moon to a full moon. The Moon also affects the tides of the oceans. Humans first visited the Moon in 1969.
